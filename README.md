Project 1 Realizing Concurrency using Unix processes and threads

To compile the c code you want to use gcc programName.c -o programName

For the problems dealing with compression if you wish to get an error output simply enter the "./ProgramName" without the arguments for the source or destination file and you will get an error

Question 1: MyCompress
Find the path to the code within your files and in your terminal change to that directory. Once your in that directory use the command ./MyCompress source.txt compressed.txt

Question 2: MyDecompress
Find the path to the code within your files and in your terminal change to that directory. Once your in that directory use the command ./MyDecompress source.txt compressed.txt

Question 3: ForkCompress
Find the path to the code within your files and in your terminal change to that directory. Once your in that directory use the command ./ForkCompress source.txt compressed.txt

Question 4: PipeCompress
Find the path to the code within your files and in your terminal change to that directory. Once your in that directory use the command ./PipeCompress source.txt compressed.txt

Question 5: compress-Process
Find the path to the code within your files and in your terminal change to that directory. Once your in that directory use the command ./compress-process source.txt compressed.txt

Question 6: MiniShell
For this you're going to be in a shell so simply enter the commands like 'ls', 'date', and 'exit'

Question 7: MoreShell
For this you're going to be in a shell so simply enter the commands like 'ls-l' or 'exit'

Question 8: DupShell
For this you're going to be in a shell so simply enter the commands like 'ls-l | wc' or 'exit'

Question 9: compression-threads
Find the path to the code within your files and in your terminal change to that directory. Once your in that directory use the command ./compression-threads source.txt compressed.txt
